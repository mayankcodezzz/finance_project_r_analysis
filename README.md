# **Financial Metrics Analysis Project** 
## Overview
This project investigates the factors influencing key financial metrics such as total debt, yearly income, credit limits, debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and PIN change due status. Using a variety of statistical models—including regression, ANCOVA, logistic regression, chi-square, and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)—the analysis uncovers patterns and relationships driven by variables like income, age, credit score, retirement status, and credit card type/brand. The findings provide actionable insights for financial planning and policy-making.

The project is based on a large dataset (2,000–6,146 entries) and aims to inform stakeholders about financial behavior trends, despite some statistical assumption violations (e.g., normality, homoscedasticity) that suggest cautious interpretation.
